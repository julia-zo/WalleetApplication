## Assumptions
* Data persistence was not required, in-memory storage is being used;
* Transactions always have positive values;
* A client only exists after it had credit added to it's wallet for the first time.

## Improvements
* Data persistence could be added to improve reliability;
* Error handling can be improved to inform more details about the error;
* Separate the service logic from the Rest logic in order to facilitate changes on the Rest layer.

## Support
If you have any question, please send an [email](mailto:juliazottis@hotmail.com).
